# ingestion-service
Platform which is an attempt to perform simple data inspection and manipulation on data extracted from a public and open API.

Written in Scala/spray using the Actor-Per-Request model, this code is extremely rough and contains no tests. It is currently 
missing exhaustive error-handling among other things. Please do not consider this representative of my production code, but 
rather as an attempt to better understand important Scala libraries and Data Science concepts.
